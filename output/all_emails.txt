That sounds good. Let me know what day you would be able to carry out a site walkthrough.

So $14,000 will likely be sufficient however we will not settle the final price right now. How we do it is that we will do a site walkthrough and then give you an estimate based on labour and materials. However, if the final cost exceeds the estimate then the price will be higher.

Yes, there is Bathroom on the second floor. In fact, there is a small storage room as well. I was wondering if C$14K would be possible to implement an electrical system. 

Also, I agree to keep this conversation confidential.

Yes of course we will negotiate further. 3 Rooms is not a large house. 

is there a bathroom on the 2nd floor?

One thing before we proceed, I ask that you agree to keep our price discussions confidential and only share them with the people within your organization. Can you agree to this?

Hi Daniel,

I have 3 rooms on the second floor. I am afraid that your typical cost exceeds my budget. Do you have any flexibility for negotiating the price?

Hi Sajeev,

It really depends on what you are asking for. Our typical charge is around $20k but please tell me more about what your are looking for.

How many rooms on the second floor?

What's the square footage?
